# KPMG_Data_Analytics
Welcome to the KPMG Job Simulation! We are thrilled to have you here.

Organisations of today need to better leverage data resources to create value, enhance competitiveness and drive business decisions.
Leaders must take a 360° view of the extraordinary volume of data available – historic, current and predictive – so they can extract what they need and make new discoveries.
KPMG’s Data, Analytics & Modelling service helps take the mystery out of big data, working with organisations to leverage data resources and produce better business outcomes.

During this program, you will get the opportunity to step into the shoes of a KPMG team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our Data Analytics team does every day. You’ll learn key skills in: Data Analysis, Customer Segmentation, Data Dashboards, and more.

We hope this program provides a great resource for you to upskill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career at KPMG.
